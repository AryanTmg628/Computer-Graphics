A circle is a set of coordinates at the given distance (r) from the center point (xc, yc)

The general circle equation is

r2 = (x - xc)2 + (y - yc)2 // using distance formula d2 = (x2-x1)2 + (y2-y1)2

There are three ways of drawing cirlce in computer :

- Simple Direct Method
- Trigonometric (PolarForm)
- Midpoint Circle or Bersenham's circle algorithm
