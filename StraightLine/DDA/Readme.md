DDA stands for Digital Differential Analyzer

Linear equations describes the theoretical path of line, while DDA maps the theoritical path to the discreate sets of pixel that can be displayed on a screen

In DDA first is we have to know how many steps do we need to draw the line

Algorithm

Step 1: Read two starting and end coordinates and store them in x1, y1, x2 and y2 respectively
Step 2: Now find out by how much in total x has increased x2 -x1 and store it in dx
Step 3: find out by how much in total y has increase y2 -y1 and store it in dy

Step 4: The main step is to find steplength, which is greater, dx or dy that will be the steplenth

Step 5: Find out how much x increases in one step = dx/steplength

Step 6 : Find out how much y increase in one step = dy/steplength
